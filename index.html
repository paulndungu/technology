                <div class="introduction">
                <p>Technology is first robustly defined by Jacob Bigelow in 1829 as: principles, processes, and nomenclatures of the more conspicuous arts, particularly those which involve applications of science, and which may be considered useful, by promoting the benefit of society, together with the emolument [compensation] of those who pursue them</p>

                <p>The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.</p>

                <div class="definitions">
                <p>The use of the term "technology" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the useful arts.</p>

                <p>The term technology rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the Second Industrial Revolution. The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with Thorstein Veblen, translated ideas from the German concept of Technik into technology. Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a crowbar or wooden spoon, or more complex machines, such as a space station or particle accelerator. Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as computer software and business methods, fall under this definition of technology.</p>

                <p>The distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. Science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.</p>

                <p>Engineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields.</p>

                <p>Hominids started using primitive stone tools millions of years ago. The earliest stone tools were little more than a fractured rock, but approximately 75,000 years ago, (method of trimming the edge of a stone tool by removing small lithic flakes) pressure flaking provided a way to make much finer work.</p>

                <p>The discovery and utilization of fire, a simple energy source with many profound uses, was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind. Fire, fueled with wood and charcoal, allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility, improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten.</p>

                <p>Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era were clothing and shelter; the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly, but they were a key to humanity's progress.</p>

                <p>Evidence suggests that human beings may have begun wearing clothing as far back as 100,000 to 500,000 years ago. Ice age humans wore furs for warmth. Not long ago, primitive cultures of the north chewed hides to make them supple. Clothing, adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals. The earliest proof of silk production in China dates from between 5000 and 3000 BC and is in the form of cocoon of the domesticated silkworm which was cut in half by a sharp knife.Silk-weaving was well established around the Mediterranean by the beginning of the 15th century.</p>

                <p>In the earliest prehistoric era, before Man knew how to build shelters, they made use of the natural environment to provide them with shelter. Trees were the earliest form and another being caves. Later it was developed as they began to build cabins on the banks of rivers and in the treetops. In the 15th century, houses were built with huge bricks of mud houses and all homes had a courtyard in the Center.</p>

                <p>Before, humans had been learning to harness other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the sailing ship; the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to the 8th millennium BCE.</p>

                <p>The invention of the wheel(invented around 4000 BCE) revolutionized trade and war. It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads. A stone pottery wheel found in the city-state of Ur dates to around 3429 BCE, and even older fragments of wheel-thrown pottery have been found in the same area. Fast (rotary) potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery, but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy (through water wheels, windmills, and even treadmills) that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources.</p>

                <p>The oldest known constructed roadways are the stone-paved streets of the city-state of Ur, dating to circa 4000 BCE and timber roads leading through the swamps of Glastonbury, England, dating to around the same time period. The first long-distance road, which came into use around 3500 BCE. In the Industrial Revolution, John Loudon McAdam designed the first modern highways, using inexpensive paving material of soil and stone aggregate (macadam).</p>

                <p>The history of rail transportation dates back nearly 500 years, and includes systems with man or horse power and rails of wood. During the 17th and 18th century, when scientists began analysing the Earth's atmosphere, gases such as hydrogen were discovered which in turn led to the invention of hydrogen balloons. the earliest clearly verifiable human flight took place in Paris in 1783 and went 5 miles (8.0 km) in a hot air balloon</p>

                </div>
                <div class="plumbing">
                <p> The word "plumber" dates from the Roman Empire. Plumbing originated during ancient civilizations such as the Greek, Roman, Persian, Indian, and Chinese cities as they developed public baths and needed to provide potable water and wastewater removal, for larger numbers of people. Ancient Minoan private homes had running water.</p>

                <p>Plumbing reached its early apex in ancient Rome, which saw the introduction of expansive systems of aqueducts, tile wastewater removal, and widespread use of lead pipes. Eventually the development of separate, underground water and sewage systems eliminated open sewage ditches and cesspools.</p>

                <p>Most large cities today pipe solid wastes to sewage treatment plants in order to separate and partially purify the water, before emptying into streams or other bodies of water. For potable water use, galvanized iron piping was commonplace in the United States from the late 1800s until around 1960. After that period, copper piping took over, first soft copper with flared fittings, then with rigid copper tubing utilizing soldered fittings.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="technisism">
                <p>Generally, technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies. Technicism is the belief that humanity will ultimately be able to control the entirety of existence using technology. In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology.</p>

                <p>More commonly, technicism is a criticism of the commonly held belief that newer, more recently developed technology is "better." For example, more recently developed computers are faster than older computers, and more recently developed cars have greater gas efficiency and more features than older cars.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="Optimism">
                <p>Optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism(international intellectual movement that aims to transform the human condition) and singularitarianism(movement defined by the belief that a technological singularity(the creation of superintelligence) will likely happen in the medium future), which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition. In these ideologies, technological development is morally good.</p>

                <p>Transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers, and that what we commonly refer to as the human condition(characteristics, key events, and situations which compose the essentials of human existence) is just another barrier to be surpassed. On the other hand, singularitarians believe in some sort of accelerating change(perceived increase in the rate of technological change), and that this will culminate in a "Singularity" after artificial general intelligence is invented in which progress is nearly infinite.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="skepticism">
                <p>Certain philosophers like Herbert Marcuse and John Zerzan, believe that technological societies are inherently flawed. They suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health. What this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno-optimists or techno-pessimists tend to allow.</p>

                <p>Some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics.</p>

                <p>In Goethe's Faust(tragic play in two parts by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe), Faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology. More recently, modern works of science fiction such as those by Philip K. Dick and William Gibson and films such as Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology's impact on human society and identity.</p>

                <p>Nikolas Kompridis has also written about the dangers of new technology, such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, and robotics. He warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings, including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature. These concerns are shared by other philosophers, scientists and public intellectuals.</p>
